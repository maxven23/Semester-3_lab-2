#2 laboratory work

  In this work I realized an IDictionary template class, based on TKey and TItem BinaryTree.
Also, there are two .h files, named "AlphabetPtr.h" and "NewTicTacToe_on_array.h" in rep;
------------------------------------------------

In the first one I realized an Alphabetical Index based on IDictionary<string, int>.
------------------------------------------------
Input:
- string with a words, separated by " " space;
- type of pagination: by words or by symbols;
- number of words|symbols on 1 page.

Output:
- IDictionary<string, int> with words and pages.
------------------------------------------------

In the second one I realized a TicTacToe game based on simple array of arrays of strings; 
You can play against AI based on minimax function of best turn or play against another Player.
------------------------------------------------
Input:
- Type of game (PVP or PVE), first turn.

Output: 
- Standart TicTacToe.
